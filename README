These notebooks are designed as tools to develop skills in seismic data analysis.  They are aimed at students doing the second year geophysics project at Oxford.  By working through these notebooks, you should learn to download, filter, and analyse the amplitude of seismic data, so that you can get going analysing your own data.

To anyone else who's stumbled here, feel free to play with the notebooks should you find them useful.
